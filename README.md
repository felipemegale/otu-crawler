# OTU Crawler

## What is this?
- Network Data Analysis project.
- In the `notebooks` folder:
    - `crawler.py` is a script that crawls all pages in the Ontario Tech University/UOIT domain and assemble the graph they form.
    - The Jupyter notebooks were used to perform simple network analysis on the graph.
- In the `report` folder:
    - LaTeX sources for the report I needed to submit about the course project.
