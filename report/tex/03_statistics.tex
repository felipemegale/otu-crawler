\section{Statistics of 6 networks}
In this section I will present some statistics about the 6 chosen networks. The results will be presented in tables. It is also noteworthy to reiterate that Gephi does not display nodes if their degree is 0.

\subsection{Number of nodes}
The number of nodes of each graph will be the amount of people who have at least one edge connecting them to another person.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Net. 1 & Net. 2 & Net. 3 & Net. 4 & Net. 5 & Net. 6 & Net. 7 \\
        \hline
        123 & 123 & 123 & 123 & 123 & 123 & 123 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Number of nodes per network}
    \label{table:1}
\end{table}

\subsection{Number of edges}
The number of edges of each graph will be the amount of connections that exist between each person for each question.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Net. 1 & Net. 2 & Net. 3 & Net. 4 & Net. 5 & Net. 6 & Net. 7 \\
        \hline
        123 & 123 & 123 & 123 & 123 & 123 & 123 \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Number of edges per network}
    \label{table:2}
\end{table}

\subsection{Edge density}

\subsection{Degree distribution}

\subsection{Average clustering coefficient}

\subsection{Number of nodes in strongly connected component (SCC)}

\subsection{Number of nodes in weakly connected component (WCC)}

\subsection{Average path length in SCC}

\subsection{Diameter of SCC}

\subsection{Community detection}
